# cardinal

Cardinal is an [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) app that checks a popular [Australian bargain](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/) web site and emails deals that match users' keywords.

### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Google Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/) and [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) (revisit).

### Project

[OzBargain](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/) is a popular Australian web site that lists user-submitted bargain deals. The submissions can be voted up or down to determine their positions on the site's pages. Cardinal checks the new submissions periodically at intervals, checks for matching keywords, and emails users according to their matched keywords.
